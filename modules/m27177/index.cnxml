We've got the tools, but are we leading with them" (Horn, 2009). Overfelt and Hutton caution education leaders to guard against letting the tools "lead us."
</para><para id="eip-306">The authors also suggest there are three dangerous paradoxes technology leaders must face and learn to lead through:</para><list id="eip-555" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic"><item>Technology can improve the interaction and dialogue between teachers and students, resulting in improved teaching and learning ...... BUT it can also isolate, marginalize, and reduce effectiveness in the classroom.</item>
	<item>Technology can offer its power to all students ...... BUT it can also segregate and deny that power.</item>
	<item>Technology can assist with engaging students in meaningful learning and promote higher-level thinking ...... BUT it can also mirror traditional instructional pedagogy.</item></list></section><para id="eip-121"><media id="eyecomputer" alt="computerwitheye">
